# parallel_programming-spring19

These programs are from my Parallel Programming Course as the University of Chicago.  The course taught students how to create multithreaded applications in C.  The general format for projects was solving an arbitrary coding problem using single and multithreaded solutions and then comparing the performance differences.  Each project has a writeup that goes into depth about what the code does and the findings from the tests.
