# parallel_programming-spring19

These files are from my Parallel Programming Course as the University of Chicago.  The course taught us how to create multithreaded applications in C.  The general format of projects was solving an arbitrary problem using single and multithreaded solutions and then comparing the performance differences.  Each project has a writeup that goes into depth about what the code does and the findings from the performance tests.
